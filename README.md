**Neural Style Transfer Application**

*Transform Your Photos with AI !*

This is a Neural Style Transfer (NST) application that allows users to apply artistic styles to their images using deep learning. Built with TensorFlow, TensorFlow Hub, and Tkinter, this interactive application enables users to select a content image and a style image, then blend them together to create a unique, AI-generated masterpiece.
Neural Style Transfer is an exciting field in deep learning that merges the content of one image with the style of another. It is widely used in digital art, photography, and creative applications to generate AI-powered artwork effortlessly. This project utilizes a pre-trained model from TensorFlow Hub, ensuring efficient and high-quality transformations.

Features:
>>User-friendly GUI – No command-line needed, just upload and click!
>>Real-time style transfer – Applies pre-trained NST models instantly.
>>Supports multiple image formats – Works with JPG, PNG, JPEG.
>>High-quality image transformation – Uses Google’s Magenta Arbitrary Image Stylization model.
>>Customizable – Modify style intensity, resolution, and model settings.
>>Cross-platform support – Works on Windows, macOS, and Linux.
>>Lightweight application – No heavy GPU required, runs efficiently on CPU as well.

Installation & Setup:
-Install Dependencies:
Ensure you have Python installed, then run:pip install tensorflow tensorflow-hub numpy matplotlib pillow tk
-Clone the Repository:
git clone https://github.com/your-username/neural-style-transfer-app.git
cd neural-style-transfer-app
-Run the Application:
python nst.py

How to Use:
1.Launch the Application by running python nst_app.py.
2.Upload Content Image (your original photo).
3.Upload Style Image (artistic image to apply style from).
4.Click Apply Style Transfer – The app will process and display the stylized image.
The application provides an easy-to-use interface where users can experiment with different styles and explore the creative potential of neural networks. The model used in this application has been trained on a variety of artistic styles, ensuring diverse transformations with high accuracy.

Technologies Used:
->Python – Core programming language
->TensorFlow & TensorFlow Hub – For deep learning models
->Tkinter – GUI for user interaction
->Pillow – Image processing
->Matplotlib & NumPy – For image handling and visualization

Future Enhancements:
*This project is a great starting point for further improvements. Here are some potential enhancements:
*Adjustable style strength – Let users control how much style to apply.
*Multiple styles blending – Combine multiple styles on a single image.
*Higher resolution outputs – Improve the quality of generated images.
*GPU acceleration – Utilize CUDA or other GPU optimizations for faster processing.
*Web-based version – Deploy as a web application using Flask or Django.
